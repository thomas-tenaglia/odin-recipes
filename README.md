# odin-recipes

This project was about creating a recipe website to practice the foundational HTML I've learnt so far.

This includes:

- HTML boilerplate frame work
- Heading tags
- Paragraph tags
- Image tags w/ resizing
- Internal linking between the index page and individual recipe pages
- lists (ordered & unordered)
