    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These donut ice cream sandwiches begin with a not-so-ordinary maple bacon
      bar, but butter pecan ice cream inside really takes them over the top. A
      maple bar will do for the sandwich, but it might be worth the trouble to
      track down a maple bacon bar. For a treat this good, who would think youâ€™d
      only need 5 minutes to make them?
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Maple Bacon Bar Donut</li>
      <li>Butter pecan Ice Cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut maple bacon bar in half, then cut each piece in half horizontally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the bottom of each bar donut half with butter pecan ice cream.
        Place the cut donut tops onto the ice cream. Serve immediately.
