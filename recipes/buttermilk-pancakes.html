    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Baking Powder</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>An Egg</li>
      <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
      <li>Bananas</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix - Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder)
        in one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed
        bananas) in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the
        wet ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your
        batter is slightly lumpy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook - Pour the batter in Â¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or
        griddle over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a
        spatula, and cook for another few minutes (or until each side is golden
        brown).
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve - Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone
        or with your favorite pancake toppings.
